I compared histograms of wind directions between 2005 and 2023 and found that a sonic orientation of 7째 offset to north yields very similar results across years. It is therefore possible the the sonic orientation on this day was also close to 7째.

Here are results from a comparison of annual wind direction histograms (with bin width of 1째) to a reference period (2006-2009), all wind directions were calculated with a north offset of 7째, then a histogram was calculated for each year. The OFFSET describes how many degrees have to be added (or subtracted) to the half-hourly wind direction to yield a histogram that is most similar to the reference. All OFFSETS are small, which indicates that the wind directions are in good agreement.
